        </a> --><h2 class="work-title work-info__title">Ending Illegal Deforestation</h2><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Illegal deforestation is a gateway activity to clearing rainforest, a primary cause of climate change. Our bio-acoustic monitoring systems give our partners the opportunity to prevent illegal logging operations when they’re happening.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr"><b>The best time to stop deforestation? Real time.</b></p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global carbon emissions per year. That’s more carbon than all transportation emissions on Earth, combined. Moreover, according to a 2008 study by The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity review, they cost the world economy anywhere between $2-5 trillion per year. For comparison’s sake, today’s digital economy is expected to increase the world’s GDP by a mere $1.3 trillion in three years: That’s pocket change compared to losses caused by deforestation.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Numbers like these are daunting. But if we’re serious about stopping climate change by preserving rainforests, the main thing we need to learn from these numbers is how to improve them - stat - in real time.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">That’s where Rainforest Connection comes into play. Using autonomous, solar-powered cellphones placed under the canopy, an RFCx system – if deployed at sufficient scale – can monitor forest soundscape 24/7 for sounds that indicate deforestation. Noises like the buzzing of chainsaws – or the muffled rumble of lumber-truck engines down unmarked roads.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">If a Rainforest Connection device “hears” a suspicious sound, it sends an instant alert to people on the ground. These people are suddenly given the option of responding to the source of the noise in real time.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr"><b>Who are these people “on the ground?”</b></p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">In a word, they’re people we’ve vetted in person – and trained to use our system. They’re park rangers in Peru, Ecuador, or Cameroon. They’re indigenous people in Brazil who’ve made that portion of the rainforest their home for hundreds – if not thousands – of years.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">What they aren’t is drones, weather satellites, camera traps, or concerned netizens of countries that don’t have rainforests. They’re the actual people in the rainforest whose daily, year-round mission is to stop illegal logging.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Defending every hectare of a rainforest from unsanctioned logging isn’t easy. But our technology – if installed properly and at scale – can make it easier.

        </a> --><h2 class="work-title work-info__title">Stop Animal Poaching</h2><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">With your help we can develop the system to help stop illegal poaching. How we do that today is we send partner rangers alerts for cars, and motorcycles that poachers use in remote protected areas to go hunting. With time and sufficient field testing, Rainforest Connection’s acoustic monitoring system can support local rangers to help turn the tide against illegal rainforest poaching in real time.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr"><b>Listening for telltale signs of poaching.</b></p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">You won’t find any other place on Earth with greater animal diversity than a rainforest. But that diversity is under continuous strain and threat from illegal poaching.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Standing in the way of poachers are indigenous peoples, park rangers and climate activists. Day in and day out, they do what they can, but the sheer density of rainforests makes it hard to detect individual acts of poaching - let alone respond to them.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Technological solutions abound, but nothing has turned the tide yet. Drones and satellites can’t follow the movements of poachers under heavy forest canopy. And while camera traps can document the aftermath of hunting, they can’t stop it from happening.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Our goal at Rainforest Connection is to ensure that poachers no longer have free reign over Earth’s rainforests. To that end, we’re developing a detection system unlike any other to date: Rather than looking for poachers, it listens for signs of them.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Here’s what we have in mind: If our bio-acoustic monitoring system detects noises that might indicate poaching, it sends an instant alert to people on the ground, giving them time enough to respond to the sound-source - and intervene, if necessary. While our system isn’t (yet) able to detect gunshots, it can detect the acoustic signatures of vehicles that poachers favor: boat engines on otherwise pristine rivers - or motorcycles speeding down unmarked roads at night.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">The black markets of Earth aren’t about to stop demanding poached animals. But by giving park rangers and indigenous peoples a monitoring system that lets them intervene against poachers, our goal is to develop a solution that can stop all that - forever and for good.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr"><b>Ever wanted to hear a rainforest in real time?

Rainforest Connection’s bio-acoustic monitoring capabilities provide scientists and conservationists with a wealth of real-time data that they can access easily online.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr"><b>Use RFCx bioacoustics to browse the worldwide rainforest.</b></p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Stopping illegal logging is only the start of what we can do with rainforest data. We think of the world’s rainforests as the most important library of life information on Earth. The sound data we gather not only allows us to monitor the health of these rainforests, but lets us share their sounds with people around the world, allowing for unparalleled data analysis.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Every birdcall, insect chirrup, rustle in the leaves, and passing drop of rainstorm: Rainforest Connection’s bio-acoustic monitoring sensors don’t merely stream data live from the field. They place it online, onto the cloud, for scientists, researchers and students across the globe to access and use.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">We aim to create a digital library that enables researchers, scientists, and climatologists to gain access to fine-grain acoustic data from some of the most remote ecosystems on Earth, no matter where they’re working from. By subscribing to our service, their support helps us incentivize, fund and support rainforest protection.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">With the world’s largest trove of real-time rainforest data to draw from, people can browse, research, correlate and understand rainforests better than ever before. Climate scientists can tune into our data streams for signs of changing rain patterns in a particular hectare of Peruvian rainforest. Biologists can listen to a specific parrot call in Brazil – and discover that it’s an entirely new species of bird. Conservationists concerned about the presence of a new road in a Cameroonian jungle can now listen in real time to how road traffic affects the behavior of wildlife surrounding it.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">The data we stream to the cloud serves as a powerful bio-acoustic repository that can give researchers, climatologists, conservationists and scientists unheard-of access to remote rainforests - in a way never done before. With your help, this archive can become the largest living library of forest sounds in the world: the worldwide rainforest.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Currently our systems generate roughly 200 MB of raw rainforest data per day – with more MB on the way. Over time, all that fine-grain cacophony – all that streaming data – adds up to a level of detail that’s without precedent.</p><p class="work-descr work-info__descr">Forget the Web for just a moment.
