We have a solution to illegal logging in rainforests.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.700
70% of logging in rainforests is illegal. -United Nations

00:08.700 --> 00:13.000
Deforestation is one of the leading causes of climate change. -United Nations

00:16.349 --> 00:18.846
This is what illegal logging looks like.

00:18.846 --> 00:21.167
Though it may seem like a small operation,

00:21.167 --> 00:23.938
in actuality, up to 90% of the rainforest logging

00:23.938 --> 00:26.994
that occurs worldwide every year is illegal.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.312
And year after year, despite many global efforts,

00:30.312 --> 00:32.064
it's accelerating rapidly. 

00:32.064 --> 00:34.121
But how is this possible?

00:34.121 --> 00:38.200
It's possible because today illegal loggers have virtually

00:38.200 --> 00:39.799
no risk of ever being caught.

00:39.799 --> 00:43.181
The current state of the art in detection is satellite surveillance,

00:43.181 --> 00:45.802
but with satellites, the updates are so infrequent

00:45.802 --> 00:49.000
that we can only know about logging activity days or weeks

00:49.000 --> 00:50.309
after it's already occurred.

00:50.309 --> 00:53.160
By then, the wood has already been cut

00:53.160 --> 00:56.016
and removed and has disappeared into the world market.

00:56.016 --> 01:00.901
What this means is that for all the global investments in stopping deforestation

01:00.901 --> 01:04.599
our only recourse is often to measure the damage that has already been done.

01:04.599 --> 01:09.018
There has never been a scalable way to actively prevent illegal logging as it occurs.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.078
My name is Topher White and I'm a Physicist and Software Engineer.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.465
We founded Rainforest Connection in 2013,

01:22.465 --> 01:26.974
because after consulting with experts in the field, we wanted to try an alternative approach to this problem.

01:26.974 --> 01:31.993
Since then, we've developed the first real-time system for stopping illegal logging.

01:31.993 --> 01:34.500
It's an amazingly simple system.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.455
We take old recycled smart phones,

01:36.455 --> 01:38.000
retrofit them with solar panels,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.868
and hide them in the tree canopy

01:39.868 --> 01:42.839
where they listen constantly for the sound profiles of illegal logging.

01:42.839 --> 01:45.786
The very moment that a chainsaw is used in the forest,

01:45.786 --> 01:49.915
the noise is picked up by our devices and using the standard GSM cell-phone network

01:49.915 --> 01:54.553
an alert is sent to local partners who can intervene immediately and actually halt the logging.

01:54.553 --> 01:57.473
This entire process happens within a matter of minutes.

01:57.473 --> 02:02.389
The devices cost very little, have no negative ecological impact on the forest,

02:02.389 --> 02:05.000
and can detect chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.200
But does it actually work?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.119
We took it to Indonesia,

02:10.119 --> 02:13.265
to one of the world's most endangered rainforests to find out.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.774
Our first partner in the field, Kalaweit,

02:16.774 --> 02:20.716
maintains a rainforest sanctuary in Sumatra to protect Gibbons,

02:20.716 --> 02:24.551
a small ape that, like countless animals, has been driven out by illegal logging.

02:24.851 --> 02:28.727
Even their well-guarded reserve is threatened daily by loggers.

02:28.727 --> 02:33.000
In cooperation with Kalaweit, we installed a prototype of our system in their reserve,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.062
and only one day later we detected our first chainsaw noises.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.484
We were able to respond immediately and arrive on the scene within minutes,

02:41.484 --> 02:43.937
effectively interrupting the loggers in the act.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.179
As news of our initial success has spread,

02:47.179 --> 02:49.865
we've been contacted by other groups who want the system too.

02:49.865 --> 02:54.787
But first, we want to perfect the design where we began with our partner, Kalaweit.

02:54.787 --> 02:58.840
To move forward we need more resources to expand our engineering team

02:58.840 --> 03:01.010
and bring our system to a point of maturity.

03:01.010 --> 03:04.955
Whereby we can scale up and offer Rainforest Connection to other rainforest reserves,

03:04.955 --> 03:07.589
NGOs, local partners and communities

03:07.589 --> 03:11.006
to assist in effectively protecting the earth's last remaining rainforests.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.900
With this simple technology and your help,

03:13.900 --> 03:18.000
we think we can stop the black market logging industry.
