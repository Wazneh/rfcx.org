00:01.390 --> 00:04.500
We have a solution to illegal logging in rainforests.

00:10.288 --> 00:14.293
70% OF RAINFOREST LOGGING IS ILLEGAL — UNITED NATIONS

00:14.293 --> 00:18.871
DEFORESTATION IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE — UNITED NATIONS

00:25.000 --> 00:26.879
This is what illegal logging looks like.

00:26.879 --> 00:29.200
Though it may seem like a small operation,

00:29.200 --> 00:33.438
in actuality, up to 90% of the rainforest logging that occurs worldwide every year is illegal.

00:35.152 --> 00:40.152
And year after year, despite many global efforts, it's accelerating rapidly.

00:40.152 --> 00:42.688
But how is this possible?

00:42.688 --> 00:47.625
It's possible, because today, illegal loggers have virtually no risk of ever being caught.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.725
This current state-of-the-art in detection is satellite surveillance,

00:51.725 --> 00:55.833
but with satellites, the updates are so infrequent,
